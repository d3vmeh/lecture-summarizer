# AI Audio/Video Transcription and Summarization with RAG

This project is an AI-powered tool that transcribes audio files from various sources, including YouTube videos and other downloaded audio/video formats. The transcriptions are saved to a Chroma database for  storage and retrieval.

### Key Features:
- **Audio/Video Transcription**: Automatically transcribes audio from YouTube videos and other audio/video files.
- **Chroma Database Integration**: Transcriptions are stored in a Chroma database.
- **Transcription Summarization**: Provides concise summaries of the transcriptions to quickly extract key information in a short form.
- **RAG-Enabled ChatBot**: Includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit. Users can interact with the chatbot, which leverages Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) to answer questions about the transcriptions or video content.

### Use Cases:
- Transcribe and summarize long audio or video content for research or note-taking.
- Ask questions about the video or transcription through a chatbot interface, powered by RAG to provide context-aware answers.
- Efficiently manage large amounts of transcribed data using the Chroma database.
